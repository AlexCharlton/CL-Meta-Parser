# CL-Meta-Parser

An OMeta inspired parser written in Common Lisp.

`meta-file.lisp` contains the code for the parser, documented in a literate style, as well as a grammar for an OMeta-like (but not object oriented) parser. The bootstrapped parser which which this grammer can be parsed is found in `grammer.lisp`.
